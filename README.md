Tesco GenAI Creative Compliance Studio : 
(An AI-Powered Retail Media Creative Builder).


Tesco GenAI Creative Compliance Studio is an AI-powered creative automation platform built in Streamlit that enables advertisers to instantly generate Tesco-compliant, multi-format retail media creatives using only a packshot and a short product description.
The tool combines Generative AI with a real-time guideline compliance engine to automate a typically resource-heavy, agency-dependent process. TGCC Studio intelligently removes packshot backgrounds, extracts brand color palettes, generates layout options, and auto-adapts designs to Facebook/Instagram formats (1:1, 9:16, 1.9:1).
A built-in Tesco Compliance Intelligence Layer performs OCR and visual rule checks—validating Drinkaware size & contrast, enforcing safe zones for social formats, detecting forbidden claims (price, sustainability, competitions), verifying value tile placement, checking minimum font sizes, and ensuring nothing overlaps restricted areas. If a violation occurs, the tool provides immediate corrective feedback.
TGCC Studio outputs download-ready JPEG/PNG creatives under 500KB, each fully aligned with Tesco and brand standards. The experience is designed for non-expert advertisers, delivering professional-quality creatives in minutes while removing risk, cost, and design complexity.
The project demonstrates the future of autonomous retail media creative production—uniting generative AI layout creation, compliance validation, and multi-channel adaptation into one scalable, user-friendly platform.
